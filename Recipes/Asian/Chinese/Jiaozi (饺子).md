# Directions
## Making Dumplings
1. In a mixing bowl, gradually add the water to the flour. Mix until no loose flour can be seen. Combine and knead into a dough.
2. Leave the dough to rest for 10 minutes, then knead again until smooth. Rest again, for 30-60 minutes.
3. While waiting for the dough to rest, finely chop the chinese cabbage and the scallions, and mix with the minced meat.
4. Sprinkle some flour onto the working surface and the rolling pin to prevent the wrappers from sticking to either.
5. Divide the dough into roughly hand-sized parts. Roll one part into a rope, then cut into equal sections. Cover the rest to prevent it from drying out.
6. Press each piece into a small disc with the palm of your hand, and use the rolling pin to flatten. It is important that the centre of the wrapper is a little thicker than the outside. Place a spoonful of filling onto the centre of the wrapper, and seal in your preferred way.
## Boiling
1. Bring a pot of water to a full boil over a high heat. Slide in the dumplings, pushing them around with the back of a spoon, and cover with a lid.
2. When the water comes back to a full boil, add about 120ml of cold water, then cover. Repeat twice.
3. Transfer to a colander, drain, rinse the dumplings briefly under tap water, and serve.
## Pan-frying
1. Heat up some oil over high heat. Place the dumplings in, making sure each dumpling is in touch with the oil.
2. When browned on the bottom, pour in cold water - enough to cover 1/3 of the dumplings. Cover with a lid, remaining on high heat.
3. Uncover when the water evaporates completely.
## Steaming
1. Use parchment paper, coat the steamer in a little bit of oil, or scatter carrot slices in the steamer baskets. Place the dumplings on top.
2. Bring water to a full boil in a pot/wok, then place the baskets over the water. Cover with a lid, then steam over medium heat for 10 minutes (or 12 minutes if steaming from frozen).
## Storing
Place assembled, uncooked dumplings on a tray lined with parchment paper or dusted with flour. Once completely frozen, the dumplings can be transferred to an airtight container. They will keep well frozen for about three months.
