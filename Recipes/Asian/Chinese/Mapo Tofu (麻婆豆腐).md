# Directions
1. *Toast the chillies. Heat a wok or small saucepan over low heat. Add half of the oil, and toss in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don't burn. Remove from heat, and set aside.*
2. Heat the remaining half of the oil in your wok, over medium heat. Add the ginger. After a minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, then turn up the heat to high. Add the minced pork. Break up the meat, and fry until it's cooked through. Add the ground sichuan peppercorns and stir for about 15 seconds.
3. Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture, and stir in well. Add the chicken broth to the wok, and stir. Let simmer for a minute. 
4. Combine the water and corn starch in a bowl. Add to the sauce, and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to thicken.====
5. Add the chilli oil. Stir into the sauce, and add the tofu. Gently toss the tofu in the sauce, and cook for 3-5 minutes.
6. Add the sesame oil and sugar, along with the scallions.
