# Directions
1. Add the kombu and water to a medium saucepan. If you have [[Kombu Dashi|cold brew kombu dashi]], add that instead of water.
2. Turn the heat to medium low, and slowly bring to almost boiling (about 10 minutes). Skim any foam and debris from the surface.
3. Just before it starts boiling, remove the kombu from the saucepan and reserve if using for something else, discard otherwise.
4. Add the katsuobushi, and bring it back to a boil again.
5. Once the dashi is boiling, reduce the heat, simmer for just 30 seconds, and turn off the heat.
6. Let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom (~10 minutes)
7. Strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl or measuring cup. Reuse the katsuobushi or discard.
