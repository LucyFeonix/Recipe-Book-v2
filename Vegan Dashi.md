1. Put the kombu and shiitake mushrooms in a large bottle, and add the water.
2. Let steep for at least 30 minutes. If possible, let steep for 2-3 hours (summertime) or 4-5 hours (wintertime).
3. Transfer to a medium saucepan. Turn the heat to medium low, and slowly bring to a bare simmer, ~10 minutes. Skim any foam and debris with a fine-mesh skimmer.
4. Just before the dashi starts boiling, remove the kombu and shiitake from the pot. Then, turn off the heat.
5. When transferring to a storage container or use, use a fine-mesh sieve to catch any debris.
