*Dashi* is a Japanese soup stock that builds the bases for many dishes like [[Miso Soup (味噌汁)]], [[Chawanmushi]], [[Ramen]], and [[Shabu Shabu]]. It is the 'authentic' Japnese flavour - being used to tell dishes apart if substitutions are being used. Homemade dashi uses carefully selected ingredients, like [[Kombu|kombu]], [[Bonito Flakes|katsuobushi]], [[Shiitake Mushrooms|shiitake mushrooms]], and [[Anchovy|anchovies]].

In general, five different types of dashi are used. When no other type is specified, the most commonly used one is awase dashi.

- [[Kombu Dashi|Kombu dashi]] is made exclusively with kombu and water.
- [[Katsuo Dashi|Katsuo dashi]] is made with dried bonito flakes
