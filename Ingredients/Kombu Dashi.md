# Ingredients
- 10g [[Kombu|kombu]]
- 1L cups water
# Notes
- 800ml yield
- Requirements: large bottle (cold), pot (hot)
- Time: 2-5 hours (cold), 10 minutes-3 hours (hot)
# Directions
## Method 1 (Cold Brew)
1. Make a couple of slits on the kombu using scissors to release more flavour.
2. Put the kombu and the water in a large bottle with a cap on it.
3. Let steep for 2-3 hours (summertime) or 4-5 hours (wintertime), or overnight in the refrigerator.
4. Remove the spent kombu. It can be used for another (milder) steep, or in [[Furikake|furikake]] or [[kombu tsukudani]].

## Method 2 (Hot Brew)
1. Put the kombu and water in a medium pot. If you have the time, soak for three hours or up to half a day.
2. Turn the heat to medium low, and slowly bring to a bare simmer, about 10 minutes.
3. Skim the foam from the surface with a fine-mesh skimmer.
4. Just before the dashi starts boiling, remove the kombu from the pot. It can (once again) be used still, or discarded.
