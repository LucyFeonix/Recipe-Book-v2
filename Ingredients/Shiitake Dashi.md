1. Place the dried shiitake mushrooms in a mason jar or airtight container, and add the water to cover the mushrooms. Place a heavy object or lid on top of the mushrooms to keep them submerged, so that they are fully rehydrated.
2.  Let them soak for a few hours (or preferably overnight). If you are in a hurry, soak them for 15 minutes or until softened.

4. Run the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve to catch any dirt or debris.
