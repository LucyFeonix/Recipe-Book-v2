> [!note] If preparing this ahead of time, leave out the garnish until the soup is reheated. This makes sure that the black rice vinegar and pepper don't lose their flavour in comparison with the garnishes.
# Directions
1. Rehydrate the mushrooms and the lily buds in warm water, until they enlarge and become soft. This will take at least one hour. Slice the mushrooms into thin strips, and tear the lily buds lengthways into thinner strands.
2. Cut the pork against the grain into thin strips. Mix with the 1/2t tsp corn starch and 1/2 tsp water, then coat with oil. Set aside.
3. Slice the carrot, bamboo shoots and tofu into thin strips. Lightly beat the egg.
4. In a wok or large pot, bring the stock to a full boil. Add the marinated pork. Quickly stir with chopsticks to separate the strands. Use a slotted spoon to skim the froth appearing on the surface.
5. Add the mushrooms, lily buds, carrot, and bamboo shoots. Leave to cook for 2 minutes.
6. Turn down the heat, and keep the soup at a gentle simmer. Slowly pour the corn starch slurry into the soup, and stir with a spoon/ladle.
7. Once the soup becomes thick, gently slide in the tofu. Slowly pour in the egg, in a circular motion.
8. When the soup starts bubbling again, turn off the heat. Add the black rice vinegar, soy sauce, white pepper and sesame oil. Give everything a gentle stir, and garnish with the coriander or scallions. Serve warm.
